## Overview

The **Price Index Management System** was developed during my 1-month internship at the DATRP of the Ministry of Equipment and Water. This internal web application is designed to streamline the management and updating of price indices for construction materials used in public works. It enhances operational efficiency by automating tasks and providing advanced tools to assist DATRP officials. 

## Objectives

- **Streamline Price Index Management**: Simplify the process of updating and managing price indices through a centralized platform.
- **Automate Routine Tasks**: Reduce manual workload by automating repetitive data entry and validation tasks.
- **Enhance Data Accuracy and Security**: Implement secure user authentication and data validation to minimize errors and protect sensitive information.
- **Leverage Advanced AI Features**: Use AI-driven tools such as chatbots to improve user interaction and facilitate learning within the organization.

## Key Features

- **Authentication System**: Secure login and user management with different levels of access to ensure data protection and control.
- **Dashboard**: Displays the latest users who accessed the application, enhancing security and monitoring capabilities.
- **Excel Importing Interface**: Allows importing Excel files with price indices, includes a robust data validation and preview system to ensure data integrity before updates.
- **Automation Thumbnails**: Features quick access to automated tasks, including the creation of canvases used by the direction for generating reports.
- **Experimental Features**:
  - **Chatbot for Price Revisions**: An experimental module using a chatbot fine-tuned with prompt engineering and RAG on a DATRP-specific corpus, assisting with price revision processes.
  - **Fraud Detection Prototype**: Leverages a classification ML model to identify potential anomalies and fraudulent data entries.
