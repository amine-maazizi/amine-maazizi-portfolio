## Overview

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being leveraged by major companies to automate tasks such as customer support, training new recruits, and knowledge retrieval. This project involved developing a customer support language model using LLaMA 3 70, fine-tuned on the Bitext Customer Support LLM Chatbot Training Dataset. This model is specifically tailored to handle frequent customer queries in e-commerce, enhancing support efficiency by providing quick and accurate responses, thus improving overall customer satisfaction.

## Objectives

- **Reduce Response Time**: Cut down response times for common customer inquiries by 50%, ensuring quicker resolution of customer issues.
- **Improve Accuracy**: Achieve a response accuracy rate of 95% for typical customer support queries, enhancing the quality of customer interactions.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensure the model integrates smoothly into existing e-commerce support workflows, providing a seamless customer service experience.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Capable of accurately interpreting customer questions and delivering relevant answers in a human-like manner.
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains context across multi-turn conversations, allowing for coherent and helpful support dialogues.
- **Customizable and Scalable**: Easily adaptable to different e-commerce platforms, scalable to handle increasing volumes of customer queries.

## Example Query

- **Client**: I want to refund the item I bought that cost $90.
- **Bot**: I'm sorry to hear that you're seeking a refund for the item you purchased for $90. To assist you with the refund process, could you please provide me with the {{Order Number}} or {{Tracking Number}}? This information will help me locate your order and guide you through the necessary steps to initiate the refund. I'm here to help you every step of the way. Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your patience as we resolve this matter.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Python**: The core language used for building and deploying the model.
  - **transformers**: Utilized for model loading, tokenization, and interfacing with the LLaMA 3 70 model.
  - **datasets**: Employed for loading and managing the Bitext Customer Support dataset efficiently.
  - **perf**: Used for performance monitoring and optimization of the model inference process.
  - **pytorch**: Provides the deep learning framework for model training and fine-tuning.
  - **trl**: Aids in implementing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for further refining model responses.

## Model Details

- **Model Availability**: The model is publicly available under the MIT license, making it easy for others to adapt and deploy in their own projects.
