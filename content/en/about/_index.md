I'm Amine Maazizi, a dedicated student with a deep passion for technology and its potential to transform everyday life. My journey began at the age of 15 when I discovered programming languages and quickly became fascinated by their power to automate daily tasks. Since then, I have explored a wide range of programming languages and tools, including Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Lua, and many more. This exploration has honed my skills in utilizing computational resources to tackle increasingly complex challenges.

My enthusiasm for automation naturally led me to the field of artificial intelligence, where Iâ€™ve delved into various facets, from general machine learning applications to fine-tuning large language models, computer vision, and generative AI. This journey has significantly enhanced my ability to create advanced automation solutions.

Currently, I am pursuing an AI Engineering degree at ENSTA Paris, the oldest engineering school in France and one of its most prestigious institutions. My studies here continue to fuel my passion and drive as I aim to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
