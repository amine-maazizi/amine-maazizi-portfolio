title: "About Me"
---

> **I'm Amine Maazizi**, a dedicated student with a deep passion for technology and its potential to transform everyday life. My journey began at the age of 15 when I discovered programming languages and quickly became fascinated by their power to automate daily tasks. Since then, I have explored a wide range of programming languages and tools, including **Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Lua,** and many more. This exploration has honed my skills in utilizing computational resources to tackle increasingly complex challenges.

> My passion for automation naturally guided me into the realm of **artificial intelligence**, where I have explored a broad spectrum of areas, including general machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms for optimization. I have also specialized in fine-tuning large language models, developing computer vision solutions, and more recently, I have developed a strong interest in generative AI. This diverse journey has profoundly enhanced my skills, enabling me to design and implement cutting-edge automation solutions that push the boundaries of technology.


> Currently, I am pursuing an **AI Engineering degree at ENSTA Paris**, the oldest engineering school in France and one of its most prestigious institutions. My studies here continue to fuel my passion and drive as I aim to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
